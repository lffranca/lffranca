# 👋 Hey there! I'm Lucas França

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** who's been playing around with code for over a decade! From **Golang** to **Java** and **Python**, I've built a lot of cool stuff, helped scale some serious tech, and worked with awesome people along the way. I love tackling big problems and coming up with clean, scalable solutions (who doesn't, right?).

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech, playing video games 🎮, or diving into a good sci-fi book.

- **Languages:** Go, Python, Java, C/C++
- **Cloud Adventures:** AWS (EKS, Kinesis, Lambda, SQS), GCP
- **DevOps Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Github Actions
- **Other Fun Stuff:** Kong API, TensorFlow, gRPC
